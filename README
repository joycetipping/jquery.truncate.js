Truncate.js

My very first jQuery plugin! It started out as an exercise, but
turned into something that Iâ€™m proud of and can see myself using
someday.

The function is called by grabbing a div using jQuery and
applying the truncate function to it:

  $('poem').truncate ();

You can pass in an object with the following options (these
are the defaults):

  { new_box        : true,
    lines_visible  : 3,
    line_height_px : 20,
    more_text      : 'more',
    less_text      : 'less' }

To style the new box, use the class selector ".truncate".
